## Task Description
Input is a large array of random integers. Divide array into N parts. 
Using parallel computing perform following processing: 
In each part leave only integers that are in between two medians of bound array parts, 
for the first parts leave numbers lower than median of next part, 
for last part leave the ones greater than bound part, concatenate arrays of output parts.

## Input generation
For the input data, `TestGenerator.cpp` and `TestGenerator.h` were created,
where `random_shuffle` is implemented, which allows you to randomly generate array and the number N.
The data is also written to the `input.txt` file.
